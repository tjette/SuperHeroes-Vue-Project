BSCA Superheroes Vue Project

Summer Part-Time 2017 Class

This is my first full stack Vue/Express/Mongoose application. To run our database,
whenever we restart or start our computer we 'must' run:

sudo mongod

then leaving the terminal/command prompt window in which we run the command
open. This project requires the following Node/npm packages:

- ExpressJS
- Body Parser
- Mongoose

npm install --save express body-parser mongoose
